I recently joined a 7-day learning camp to implement a bare minimum version of React from scratch. Some of the learning methods really aligned with mine, and some were new to me. It works for me, hope you find this useful!

&nbsp;

## Learning Fundamentals Should Be Prioritized
I know it's boring to practice basics while there are tons of fancy libraries and frameworks out there. But you should also know the fundamentals provide a strong foundation that'll support your future learning. They're the “building blocks” upon which more advanced knowledge is built. Take web development as an example, if you don't have a solid understanding of javascript, you barely can learn React/Vue well.
    
&nbsp;

## Finding Core Concepts Of The New Technology
Before you dive into a new technology, it's always worth spending some time figuring out what the core concepts/functionalities really are. Then start with it, rather than learning everything all at once. Core concepts first, addons can come second. Still take React as an example, core concepts consists of virtual dom, JSX,  state and UI manipulation, component reusability, props, hooks...etc. Addons may like Router, Redux...etc.

## Breaking Down Into Microtasks
Now that you've got the prerequisites out of the way and you know where to start, you're probably excited and eager to get started. But wait, there's one last step: make it easier and more manageable via breaking down the entire task into many microtasks(Yes, browsers already told us that, lol). Splitting tasks is also a very important skill that takes a lot of practice and trial and error to master. It can be applied anywhere, for example, when you start building a new feature, first and foremost, you just need to focus on implementing it. Then you can handle some edge cases. Last but not least, do not forget to refactor your code.
    
&nbsp;

## Using Resources Wisely
So far, it's time to get started. For each microtask, you need to do both input and output. Keep in mind understanding a concept isn’t the same as applying a skill. Another thing is, when you use resources, such as watching videos or tech blogs, do not just learn the superficial code,  think more about why, and what are the advantages and downsides, make sure you understand clearly. If that's so complex, it can be helpful to use a diagram to analyze it. In short, make sure you've learned problem-solving mindset rather than memorizing code. 

&nbsp;

## Practice Makes Perfect
After input, you know what's the next! Yes, output! You barely can learn swimming just via watching videos, no matter how amazing these videos are. Learning is a process, and output plays a significant role in this process. Whatever you learn, the only secret is to keep practicing, and practicing, and practicing. That's how brain works.

&nbsp;
    
## Sharing With Others
People say, "Knowledge has no value unless you use and share it." Sharing what you've learned is also a kind of output, but at a higher level I personally think. Some people can only use it by themselves, some others can share it with people, but in a complex way especially for the hard questions, but there also few people they can make complex things very brief and understandable. These people are masters. So sharing knowledge not only helps you reinforce your knowledge, but also challenges your understanding of it. 

&nbsp;

In a nutshell, learning is a lifelong project, you should find your own way to learn new things efficiently and comfortably. Hope my strategies can give you some inspiration.
