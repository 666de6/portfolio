I prioritize achieving a healthy work-life balance, which allows me to indulge in my passions during my spare time. This enables me to find fulfillment in both my professional endeavors and personal interests.

## Yoga & Meditation
For nearly five years, I've immersed myself in the practice of yoga and meditation. Discovering inner peace through these disciplines has been a profound and transformative experience. Moreover, yoga has deepened my understanding of my body and its capabilities.

## Coffee
Before delving into programming, I was a barista. In this role, I not only mastered the art of crafting and appreciating coffee but also delved deep into the rich coffee culture. Furthermore, it provided ample opportunities to refine my communication skills through interactions with a diverse range of people. Brewing and enjoying coffee remains an integral part of my daily routine.

## Learning Languages
Learning a new language is not merely about acquiring a new skill, it's about gaining a fresh perspective on the world. Each new language opens a door to understanding and connection. Having already embarked on this journey, I eagerly anticipate further linguistic exploration in the future.

## Reading
While I may not have cultivated a habit of reading in my first three decades, LOL, my journey with the English language sparked a newfound love for it. Initially, I use some simple English books as a learning tool, but soon I found peace and enrichment in the act of reading itself.

## Minimalist
Embracing minimalism and slow living has had a profound impact on my life. By adhering to the principle of "less is more," I've cultivated a lifestyle that is intentional, meaningful, and imbued with a sense of lightness. This minimalist approach has guided my choices in all aspects of life, leading to greater clarity and fulfillment.
