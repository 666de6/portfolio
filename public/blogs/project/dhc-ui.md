# DHC UI Library
This project entails the creation of an internal UI component library aimed at enhancing developer efficiency. By extracting common elements into reusable components, we've streamlined development processes. This initiative not only fosters consistency in system styles but also significantly boosts development efficiency.

&nbsp;

Our component library emulates popular mainstream libraries, providing comprehensive component demonstrations alongside auto-generated code snippets. This dual functionality simplifies adoption for developers, streamlining their workflow and enhancing productivity.
